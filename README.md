Hyperspectral & Thermal Anomaly Detection

This repository provides code and resources for spectral-spatial anomaly detection in hyperspectral and thermal (IR) remote sensing datasets. The goal is to detect manmade anomalies, suppress natural anomalies, and improve interpretability for applications such as environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, industrial activity tracking, wildfire detection, and disaster management.

üîç Problem Overview
	‚Ä¢	Hyperspectral Images: Contain hundreds of contiguous spectral bands (400‚Äì2500 nm), where each pixel has a spectral signature enabling material identification.
	‚Ä¢	Thermal Images: Capture surface temperature variations, useful for detecting anomalies like fires, machinery operations, or industrial heat signatures.

Detecting anomalies in such datasets requires robust deep learning and generative AI approaches capable of handling high-dimensional data and fusing multiple sensor modalities.
